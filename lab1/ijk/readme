This folder includes the runs that we did for IJK loop.
Matrix32 - Matrix multiplication for 32 x 32 matrix size
Matrix512 - Matrix multiplication for 512 x 512 matrix size
Matrix4096 - Matrix multiplication for 4096 x 4096 matrix size
Matrix8192 - Matrix multiplication for 8192 x 8192 matrix size

Each folder has a script called data.py

How to run the script:
python data.py

This script will generate 3 files

1) output: contains the averge result for all perf events
2) result: Contains the value of our L1,L2 and L3 misses.
3) cycles: contails the number of cycles the code executed.

The script cycles.py will generate program execution time for all matrix multiplications.
